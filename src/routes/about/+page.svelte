        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
            I'm Pedro, an amateur photographer based in Belo Horizonte, Brazil.
            I actually work full-time as Data Platform Engineer. So I work a lot with
            technology, data, AI and programming. But I also
            love photography, and when I have time, I take my camera,
            and shoot on the streets, documenting life as it happens.
        </p>

            <img src="HTZ_0219-2.jpg" alt="My photo" width="35%" />
        </figure>

        <p>
            I personally love street and portrait photography. These
            are the styles of photography that I'm most interested in.
